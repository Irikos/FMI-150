          <h3><span>Brief History</span></h3>
		  <span class = "textmain">
			In 1864, the year when the University of Bucharest was founded, the Faculty of Sciences - founded itself in 1863 - represented one of the three faculties composing the University of Bucharest and since 1866 it split into two departments, namely the Department of Physical and Mathematical Sciences and the Department of Physical and Natural Sciences, respectively. The former department became itself an autonomous faculty, i.e. the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, in 1948, whilst in 1961 it split again into two faculties, namely the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics and the Faculty of Physics. In the period of time 1974-2001, the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics was known as the Faculty of Mathematics and finally renamed as the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science in 2001.			
			<p class = "textmain">A first landmark in the history of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science was represented by the employment of Spiru Haret, David Emmanuel, Constantin Gogu and Nicolae Coculescu as professors of the faculty, all of them after having been awarded a PhD in mathematics in Paris, France, and hence being the first Romanian mathematicians in this position. Apart from David Emmanuel, whose PhD thesis was devoted to Abelian integrals of the third kind, the aforementioned professors dealt, in their theses, with celestial mechanics problems. Spiru Haret was not only a brilliant professor of Rational Mechanics, but also, most likely, the most important Romanian Minister of Education, at the same time being the truly reformist of the Romanian educational system through the law promoted in 1898. David Emmanuel was also considerd by prominent Romanian mathematicians, such as Țițeica, Lalescu, Stoilow etc, as their mentor.
